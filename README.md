## Project 1
### Fraud Detection
Frauds in credit card transactions are common today, thanks to the advancement of technology and increase in online transaction but there is also increase in credit card frauds causing huge loss. 

Therefore, there’s need for effective methods to detect and prevent frauds. You are encouraged to use the multiple algorithms of Machine learning like support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (Knn) and artificial neural network (ANN) in predicting the occurrence of the fraud.

Further, analyze and comment on the results achieved by different machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify fraud and non-fraud transactions

## Project 2
### Car Price Prediction
Car Price Prediction is a really an interesting machine learning problem as there are many factors that influence the price of a car in the second-hand market.
In this competition, we will be looking at a dataset based on sale/purchase of cars where our end goal will be to predict the price of the car given its features to maximize the profit.

## Project 3
### Thyroid Disease Prediction
Thyroid disease is a major cause of formation in medical diagnosis and in the prediction, onset to which it is a difficult axiom in the medical research. Thyroid gland is one of the most important organs in our body. The secretions of thyroid hormones are culpable in controlling the metabolism. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are one of the two common diseases of the thyroid that releases thyroid hormones in regulating the rate of body's metabolism. Data cleansing techniques were applied to make the data primitive enough for performing analytics to show the risk of patients obtaining thyroid. The machine learning plays a decisive role in the process of disease prediction.

## Project 4
### Black Friday Sales Prediction
This dataset comprises of sales transactions captured at a retail store. It’s a classic dataset to explore and expand your feature engineering skills and day to day understanding from multiple shopping experiences. This is a regression problem. The dataset has 550,069 rows and 12 columns.
Problem: Predict purchase amount.

Data Overview :
Dataset has 537577 rows (transactions) and 10 columns as described below:

User_ID: Unique ID of the user. There are a total of 5891 users in the dataset.


Product_ID: Unique ID of the product. There are a total of 3623 products in the dataset.

Gender: indicates the gender of the person making the transaction.

Age: indicates the age group of the person making the transaction.

Occupation: shows the occupation of the user, already labeled with numbers 0 to 20.

City_Category: User's living city category. Cities are categorized into 3 different categories 'A', 'B' and 'C'.

7.Stay_In_Current_City_Years: Indicates how long the users has lived in this city.

Marital_Status: is 0 if the user is not married and 1 otherwise.

Product_Category_1 to _3: Category of the product. All 3 are already labeled with numbers.

Purchase: Purchase amount.


## Project 5

### Data Science Jobs
A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who successfully pass some courses which conduct by the company. Many people signup for their training. Company wants to know which of these candidates are really wants to work for the company after training or looking for a new employment because it helps to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning the courses and categorization of candidates. Information related to demographics, education, experience are in hands from candidates signup and enrollment.
This dataset designed to understand the factors that lead a person to leave current job for HR researches too. By model(s) that uses the current credentials, demographics, experience data you will predict the probability of a candidate to look for a new job or will work for the company, as well as interpreting affected factors on employee decision.
The whole data divided to train and test . Target isn't included in test but the test target values data file is in hands for related tasks. A sample submission correspond to enrollee_id of test set provided too with columns : enrollee _id , target

Note: The dataset is imbalanced.
Most features are categorical (Nominal, Ordinal, Binary), some with high cardinality.
Missing imputation can be a part of your pipeline as well.

Features
enrollee_id : Unique ID for candidate

city: City code

city_ development _index : Developement index of the city (scaled)

gender: Gender of candidate

relevent_experience: Relevant experience of candidate

enrolled_university: Type of University course enrolled if any

education_level: Education level of candidate

major_discipline :Education major discipline of candidate

experience: Candidate total experience in years

company_size: No of employees in current employer's company

company_type : Type of current employer

lastnewjob: Difference in years between previous job and current job

training_hours: training hours completed

target: 0 – Not looking for job change, 1 – Looking for a job change

Inspiration

Predict the probability of a candidate will work for the company

Interpret model(s) such a way that illustrate which features affect candidate decision
